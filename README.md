Hey there,

Thanks again for the consideration. I used angular/cli to get the boilerplate setup. 
I also added some bootstrap just for some visual clarity.

Used a data.json file of countries as sample data and HttpModule to set up data fetching.
Both filter & sorting features should be working fine. Simply click on the title of the column.

Let me know if you want me to make any changes.

Cheers,
Anthony Sarno




## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
